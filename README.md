# UnityPhysics
This project is an example of a real-time simulation of cloths animations in unity. We use a Taylor approximation and we update at constant time steps. The project is designed to use on plain objects, however, a volumetric approximation using tetrahedrons created by [tetgen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1) is been included.

A web version of the examples can be found at <https://iagocl.github.io/unityAnimator/>.

A video can also be found at <https://youtu.be/7ZcRD_zBRuA> an example without menu is also available at <https://youtu.be/9F6HdxM5x98>.
